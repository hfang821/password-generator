# Password Generator

## Description:

* This tool is designed to help people who need to generate a random password to safely store their documents based on their requirements.
* This project was completed based on the basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript concepts, producing a easy-to-use tool simply by clicking a button!
* During the process of building the password generator, I have learned how to use using if statements and for loops in functions, As well as using Chrome's Console to troubleshoot bugs. 
## Built By:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## How to Install:

Windows Users: 
* Open Gitbash, navigate towards your project location from your root by using "cd ./ project location"
* Choose a clone option from my "run-buddy" repository (either HTTPS or SSH should work)
* In Gitbash, type "git clone HTTPS or SSH"
* Once the clone is successful, you are ready to go!

MacOS Users:
Coming Soon!

## How to Use the tool:
1. Enter your preferred rules of setting the password. (i.e. if you need special characters, how many characters in the password, etc)
2. Click the "Generate Password" Button and your password is shown in the central box.
3. Copy the password to be used.
