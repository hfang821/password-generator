# Password Generator

## Description:

* This tool is designed to help people who need to generate a random password to safely store their documents based on their requirements.
* This project was completed based on the basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript concepts, producing a easy-to-use tool simply by clicking a button!
* During the process of building the password generator, I have learned how to use using if statements and for loops in functions, As well as using Chrome's Console to troubleshoot bugs. 
## Built By:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## How to Install:

Windows Users: 
* Open Gitbash, navigate towards your project location from your root by using "cd ./ project location"
* Choose a clone option from my "run-buddy" repository (either HTTPS or SSH should work)

* Once the clone is successful, you are ready to go!
